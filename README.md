Angular Sticky Nav
==================

An angular directive for top navs that should stay on top as you scroll down. *(Of course this could work with any element you'd want that for. Weird.)*

##Features
* Vanilla: JavaScript
* Sprinkles: No classes are added, no CSS files or configuration is needed
* Chocolate: Considers if you have an element above your nav, say, a heading
* Cream: Recalculates element position on page load and on window resize


##Bower
```bash
bower install ngStickyNav
```

##Usage
[TODO]
